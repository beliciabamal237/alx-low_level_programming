0x00. C - Hello, World



**This directory contains scripts and c source files. It shows how scripts can be used to manipulate C programs**

0. Preprocessor
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
The output should be saved in the file c

1. compiler - compiles a C file but does not link.

2. assembler - generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

3. name - compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

4. puts.c - prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

Use the function puts.
You are not allowed to use printf.
Your program should end with the value 0.

5. printf.c - prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.

Use the function printf
Not allowed to use the function puts
Program should return 0

6. size.c
 
 prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

7. Intel

Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.

The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.

The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.

Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s

8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity

Write a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.

You are not allowed to use any functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) printf or man (3) puts

Your program should return 1

Your program should compile without any warnings when using the -Wall gcc option
